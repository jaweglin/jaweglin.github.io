Procter & Gamble set us a brief to help them come up with a solution for the lack of sales. During these three days of research and ideation, we found that many customers have a hard time relating to the painted illusion that the fragrance campaigns are bringing today. Our solution is Eau de Arte that cater for a real lifestyle by using a new type of framework between brands and artists. No more illusions of a lifestyle customers canâ€™t relate to. The collaborations could take place in form of an exhibition, installations, events etc.	</div>
