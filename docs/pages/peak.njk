This module at Hyper Island we were 12 people that set up our own agency, creating culture, values, mission and vision. We worked agile with four clients for different briefs (Nyhetsbolaget, Novare, Oriflame and Liberalerna.) My role was Creative & UX. I worked with concept for our visual branding & identity and making our logo etc. I did the wireframes for Nyhetsbolaget and animated the video below.		</p>
