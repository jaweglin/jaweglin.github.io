Peak Performance challenged Hyper Island students with a brief to create a branding idea for their new concept store opening on GÃ¶rgatan, Stockholm in the new year. My team decided to take advantage of the attractive busy shopping area and combine darkness with lights. The result became a window installation with Northern lights projected on a smoke screen. By using Arduino we programmed the installation to trigger when someone walks by and to follow the persons movement. In this project I was in charge of programming the installation using the program Processing.
