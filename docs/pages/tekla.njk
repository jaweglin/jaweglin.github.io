			For this project we helped Teklafestivalen to improve their current website with better UX and UI. We wanted to create a solution for the girls that could not attend the event to interact with the page throughout the year as well as on the day of the event. I was in charge of editing the concept video as well as participating in the UX, research and I wireframes for signing up.
