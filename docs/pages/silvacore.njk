			The company Silvacore currently works towards a sustainable forestry in Sweden with a plan to expand within a few years. Our goal was to help them with branding and identity, using strategic methods and workshops. The clientâ€™s wish was to aim for higher decision makers and governmental support and had been met by resistance. Our solution would be to go though the young generation Y that will be the next forest owners in a near future and who are open to change. In this project I took part in creating the brand book as well as research, ideation and to create the informative concept video.
